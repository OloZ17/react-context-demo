# React Context Demo

A demonstration project showcasing React Context API usage, built with Vite, TypeScript, and Vitest.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Vitest** - Fast unit testing framework
- **Testing Library** - React component testing utilities

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode with Vite's dev server.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will hot-reload when you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches Vitest in watch mode.\
Tests will automatically re-run when you make changes to your code.

### `npm run test:ui`

Launches Vitest with a browser-based UI for a better testing experience.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Runs tests and generates a coverage report.\
Coverage reports will be available in the `coverage` directory.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes for cache busting.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`
